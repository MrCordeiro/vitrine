# vitrine — Play Store screenshot pipeline CLI

## Problem Statement

Updating the Google Play listing for our React Native (Expo) Android app is manual and painful: capturing screenshots by hand, styling them in a design tool, and uploading them through the Play Console UI. Production builds take ~30 minutes and run locally, so any pipeline that depends on a fresh production build is a non-starter. We want screenshots to become a one-command artifact.

## Goals

1. Refresh the entire Play Store screenshot set with a single command run locally.
2. Capture works against **any installed build** (a plain Metro-backed debug build, an Expo dev client, or the last local APK) — never requires the 30-minute production build.
3. Framing produces store-compliant, professional images from templates with zero design-tool work.
4. Publishing updates the live listing via the Play Developer API with a safe dry-run mode.
5. The package is structured so it can later be published to npm (`npx vitrine ...`) and extended with an AI diff-discovery layer.

## Non-Goals (v0)

- **iOS / App Store Connect** — Android only; the app is Android-only today.
- **Localization** — single locale (`en-US`) hardcoded as a config default; the config schema should carry a `locale` field so multi-locale is additive later.
- **CI integration** — local-first. No GitHub Actions work in v0.
- **AI diff-discovery** (reading git diffs to find new screens) — this is the eventual differentiator but layers on top of the deterministic core. Do not build it; do not block it architecturally. The AI layer will work by editing `screenshots.config.ts` and Maestro flows, so keeping config as the single source of truth is the only architectural requirement.
- **Full design editor** — 2–3 fixed layout templates only. No per-pixel positioning.
- **APK building/uploading** — the tool never builds or uploads app binaries, only listing images.

## Architecture Overview

TypeScript CLI package, Node 20+, developed in its **own standalone repo** (not inside the app repo — Metro's upward `node_modules` resolution and file watching conflict with nested packages, and a separate repo matches the goal of publishing to npm). The app repo is the first consumer: it holds only `screenshots.config.ts`, `flows/`, the gitignored `secrets/`, and its instantiation of the infra module, and installs the tool as a dev dependency (via `npm pack` tarball until published).

Three independent commands sharing one config file:

```
screenshots.config.ts ──► capture ──► screenshots/raw/*.png
                          frame   ──► screenshots/framed/*.png
                          publish ──► Google Play listing
```

- **CLI framework**: `commander`
- **Config validation**: `zod` (config is a `.ts` file loaded via `jiti` or `tsx`, exporting a typed object)
- **Capture**: shells out to `maestro` and `adb` (both assumed installed; fail with actionable error messages if missing)
- **Framing**: `sharp` for compositing; no headless browser
- **Publish**: direct Google Play Developer API (`adroidpublisher v3`) via `googleapis`, service-account JSON auth.

Each command must be independently runnable and independently useful.

## How this differs from a standard Maestro setup

Maestro is normally used as an E2E **testing** tool (`maestro test .maestro/`, pass/fail semantics, artifacts in `~/.maestro/`). Here it is repurposed as a deterministic **navigation engine for screenshots**, which changes several conventions — implement accordingly:

- **Flows are not tests.** Each flow's job is to reach one screen in a known-good state and call `takeScreenshot` once. Assertions (`assertVisible`) are used as *readiness gates* before capturing (wait until UI settled), not as the flow's purpose. A flow "passes" when its screenshot exists.
- **The CLI orchestrates, not Maestro.** We do not run `maestro test` on a directory. The CLI invokes flows individually, in config order, so it can map outputs to screen ids, support `--only`, and produce a per-screen summary. Config (`screenshots.config.ts`) is the source of truth for *which* flows run — not the filesystem.
- **Output location is ours.** Screenshots must land in `screenshots/raw/<id>.png` (use `maestro test --output` / `working-dir` control or move artifacts post-run), never left in Maestro's default artifact directory. The `takeScreenshot` name ↔ screen `id` convention is validated by the CLI.
- **Determinism over coverage.** Standard Maestro suites tolerate flakiness with retries and test many paths. Re-runs produce visually identical screens — this feeds the golden-image pipeline.
- **Device lifecycle is managed by the CLI**, not by the developer or Maestro Cloud: detect running emulator via `adb devices`, boot the configured AVD when absent, install the APK if `apkPath` is set. No Maestro Cloud / hosted execution in v0.
- **App state, not app build.** Flows run against whatever build is installed (dev client or old APK). Nothing in the Maestro layer may assume a fresh production build.

## Config Schema (source of truth)

Example `screenshots.config.ts` the tool must support:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitrine";

export default defineConfig({
  app: {
    packageName: "com.example.myapp",
    apkPath: "./builds/app-release.apk", // optional; if omitted, assume app already installed
  },
  device: {
    avd: "Pixel_7_API_34",      // emulator to boot if none running
    locale: "en-US",
  },
  frame: {
    template: "gradient",        // "gradient" | "solid" | "minimal"
    background: ["#1a1a2e", "#16213e"], // solid color or gradient stops
    textColor: "#ffffff",
    font: "Inter",               // bundled font(s); no system font dependence
  },
  publish: {
    serviceAccountKeyPath: "./secrets/play-service-account.json",
    track: "listing",            // images only; field reserved for clarity
  },
  screens: [
    {
      id: "home",
      flow: "flows/home.yaml",   // Maestro flow that ends on the target screen
      caption: "Track everything in one place",
    },
    {
      id: "profile",
      flow: "flows/profile.yaml",
      caption: "Your data, your way",
    },
  ],
});
```

Example Maestro flow (`flows/home.yaml`):

```yaml
appId: com.example.myapp
---
- launchApp:
    clearState: true
- assertVisible: "Home"
- takeScreenshot: home
```

Convention: each flow's `takeScreenshot` name must match the screen `id`. `capture` validates this and errors clearly on mismatch.

## Requirements

### P0 — `capture`

- [ ] Reads and zod-validates config; fails with human-readable errors on invalid config.
- [ ] Detects a running emulator via `adb devices`; if none, boots the configured AVD and waits for boot completion.
- [ ] If `apkPath` is set, installs it (`adb install -r`); otherwise verifies the package is installed and errors helpfully if not.
- [ ] Runs each screen's Maestro flow sequentially; collects PNGs into `screenshots/raw/<id>.png`.
- [ ] `--only <id,id>` flag to capture a subset.
- [ ] Non-zero exit code and a summary table (captured / failed) at the end.

### P0 — `frame`

- [ ] Composites each `screenshots/raw/<id>.png` into a store-ready image: device bezel overlay, background (solid or 2-stop linear gradient), caption text above the device.
- [ ] Output: `screenshots/framed/<id>.png` at **1080×1920 (9:16)**, PNG, under Play's 8 MB limit.
- [ ] Three templates: `gradient` (caption top, device centered-bottom, gradient bg), `solid` (same layout, flat bg), `minimal` (no bezel, subtle shadow, caption top).
- [ ] Bundle one open-license font (e.g. Inter) and one generic Android bezel asset in the package; render text with sharp's SVG compositing so output is deterministic across machines.
- [ ] Idempotent: re-running produces byte-identical output for identical inputs (required for golden tests).

### P0 — `publish`

- [ ] Auths with a service account key; clear error if key invalid or lacks permissions.
- [ ] Uses the androidpublisher v3 **edits** flow: `edits.insert` → `edits.images.deleteall` (phoneScreenshots, configured locale) → upload framed images in config order → `edits.validate` → `edits.commit`.
- [ ] `--dry-run`: performs everything through `edits.validate`, then **deletes the edit instead of committing**. Prints what would change.
- [ ] Uploads in the order screens appear in config (order = listing order).
- [ ] Prints a link to the Play Console listing page on success.

### P1

- [ ] `vitrine init` — scaffolds config, `flows/` with one example, `.gitignore` entry for secrets.
- [ ] `capture --serial <device>` to target a specific device/emulator.
- [ ] Feature graphic (1024×500) generation from the same frame templates.
- [ ] Progress/spinner output (`ora` or similar).

### P2 (design for, don't build)

- iOS capture + App Store Connect publishing.
- Multi-locale: config `screens[].caption` becomes `Record<locale, string>`; capture loops locales.
- AI diff-discovery agent that edits config + flows on PRs.
- CI workflow templates.

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit**: config validation (zod cases), publish payload construction (mock `googleapis`).
- **Golden-image tests for `frame`**: commit fixture raw PNGs + expected framed outputs; compare with `pixelmatch`, threshold 0 (framing must be deterministic). This is the core regression suite.
- **Integration (manual, documented in README)**: `capture` against a local emulator; `publish --dry-run` against the real API — the edits API is transactional, so nothing touches the live listing until commit.
- **Package-level**: test via `npm pack` + install the tarball into the app repo (closer to real consumption than `npm link`).

## Infrastructure (IaC)

The only cloud infrastructure this project needs is Google Cloud plumbing for the Play Developer API. The tool repo ships this as a reusable **OpenTofu** module in `infra/` (the HCL below is also plain-Terraform-compatible); the app repo instantiates it with its own `project_id`:

```hcl
# infra/main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    google = { source = "hashicorp/google", version = "~> 6.0" }
  }
}

variable "project_id" { type = string }

provider "google" {
  project = var.project_id
}

# Enable the Play Developer API on the project
resource "google_project_service" "androidpublisher" {
  service            = "androidpublisher.googleapis.com"
  disable_on_destroy = false
}

# Service account the CLI authenticates as
resource "google_service_account" "vitrine" {
  account_id   = "vitrine-publisher"
  display_name = "vitrine Play listing publisher"
}

# Key used by `vitrine publish` (JSON)
resource "google_service_account_key" "vitrine" {
  service_account_id = google_service_account.vitrine.name
}

resource "local_sensitive_file" "key" {
  content_base64 = google_service_account_key.vitrine.private_key
  filename       = "${path.module}/../secrets/play-service-account.json"
}

output "service_account_email" {
  value = google_service_account.vitrine.email
}
```

Requirements:

- [ ] `infra/` ships with the module above, a `terraform.tfvars.example`, and a README section: `tofu init && tofu apply -var project_id=...`.
- [ ] `secrets/` is gitignored; state file handling documented (local state is fine for a single dev; note the SA key lives in state).
- [ ] No GCP IAM role bindings — this is intentional. Play listing permissions are **not** GCP IAM; they are granted inside Play Console.

**Manual steps that cannot be automated** (no Terraform/API surface exists for Play Console account linking — document these in the README as a checklist):

1. Play Console → **Users and permissions** → invite the `service_account_email` output.
2. Grant the account **"Manage store presence"** (edit store listing) for the app.
3. Wait up to a few minutes for propagation, then run `vitrine publish --dry-run` to verify.

## Milestones

1. **capture** (days 1–3): CLI scaffold, config loader/validation, emulator + adb orchestration, Maestro runner. Exit criteria: raw PNGs for all configured screens from one command.
2. **frame** (days 4–6): compositor + 3 templates + golden tests. Exit criteria: deterministic framed set at 1080×1920.
3. **publish** (days 7–8): `infra/` OpenTofu module + README checklist first, then API client, dry-run, commit path. Exit criteria: `tofu apply` produces a working key, dry-run passes validation against the real listing, one successful real commit.

Ship each milestone as a working increment — do not start `frame` until `capture` works end-to-end on the real app.

## Open Questions

- **Bezel asset** (owner: dev): source an openly-licensed generic Android frame PNG, or generate a simple rounded-rect bezel programmatically in sharp? Programmatic is acceptable for v0 and avoids licensing questions — prefer it unless quality is unacceptable.
- **Config format** (non-blocking): `.ts` config is the default; decide during implementation whether to also accept `.json` for zero-tooling consumers.
- **Play Console linking** (owner: repo owner, blocking for milestone 3 only): the OpenTofu module provisions the API + service account + key, but the Play Console invite/permission grant (see Infrastructure section) is manual and must happen before `publish --dry-run` can be tested.
